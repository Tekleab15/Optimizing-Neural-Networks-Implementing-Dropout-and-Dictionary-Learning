# Optimizing-Neural-Networks-Implementing-Dropout-and-Dictionary-Learning
## Description
This repository focuses on optimizing neural networks with dropout and dictionary learning techniques. It includes:

### Task 1: Implementing Dropout in Neural Networks
- **Objective:** Train a model with dropout on the Natural Scene Classification dataset. Analyze its effects on accuracy and overfitting.
- **Technologies Used:** TensorFlow, Keras

### Task 2: Implementing Dictionary Learning for Sparse Representations
- **Objective:** Use dictionary learning to represent images with sparse components and visualize the learned dictionary.
- **Technologies Used:** Scikit-learn, OpenCV

## Contents
- **Dataset:** Natural Scene Classification dataset from Kaggle
- **Code:** Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for each task
- **Results:** Analysis and visualizations

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tekleab15/Optimizing-Neural-Networks-Implementing-Dropout-and-Dictionary-Learning.git
